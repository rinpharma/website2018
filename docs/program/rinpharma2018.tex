The first annual R/Pharma conference will be held Wednesday, August 15th
and Thursday, August 16th at Harvard University, Cambridge,
Massachusetts, USA.

R/Pharma is an
\href{https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/isc-working-groups}{ISC
working group} under the R Consortium. The conference is envisioned as a
relatively small, scientifically \& industry oriented, collegial event
focused on the use of R in the development of pharmaceuticals. The
conference will cover topics including reproducible research, regulatory
compliance and validation, safety monitoring, clinical trials, drug
discovery, research \& development, PK/PD/pharmacometrics, genomics,
diagnostics, immunogenicity and more. All will be discussed within the
context of using R as a primary tool within the drug development
process. The conference will showcase the current use of R that is
helping to drive biomedical research, drug discovery \& development, and
clinical initiatives. (Note that topics related to the use of R in
hospitals/clinics for patient care by clinicians, doctors, and
researchers will likely be the focus of the upcoming R/Medicine
conference.)

The conference will be a single track conference consisting of keynotes
from renowned industry practitioners to key R developers to leading
academics, pre-conference workshops and full-length presentations as
well as a number of shorter, highly-energetic lightning talks.

R/Pharma is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
disability or any feature that distinguishes human beings. For more
information, please see the
\href{https://wiki.r-consortium.org/view/R_Consortium_and_the_R_Community_Code_of_Conduct}{R
Consortium code of conduct}.

\emph{Wednesday, 15th August from 14:50 - 15:35}

The tidyverse (tidyverse.org) is an opinionated collection of R packages
designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design
philosophy, grammar, and data structures. The packages primarily consist
of tools for data ingest, manipulation, and visualization. In the last
year or so, Rstudio and others have been creating a set of packages
focused on the modeling process. In this talk, we will introduce the
tidyverse and illustrate these new tools whose goals are to: simplify
the modeling process, encourage empirical validation and good
methodology, and to enable a wider variety of approaches.

\textbf{Joe Cheng}, RStudio

\emph{Thursday, 16th August from 09:25 - 10:10}

Shiny is a package for turning analyses written in R into interactive
web applications. This capability has obvious applications in pharma, as
it lets R users build interactive apps for their collaborators to
explore models or results, or to automate workflows. However, the
interactivity of Shiny apps is a double-edged sword, as it introduces
challenges to the traceability and reproducibility of your analysis. To
use interactive applications in pharma responsibly, these challenges
must be addressed. In this talk, I'll look at some of the tools and
techniques you can use in Shiny to deal with these challenges head-on.

\emph{Thursday, 16th August from 14:50 - 15:35}

The open-source analytics community is driving innovation in
precompetitive spaces like statistical methodology, reproducibility
approaches, visualization techniques, and scaling strategies. The
diverse and rapdily evolving ecosystem of open-source tools and
standards stands in contrast with the disposition of the enterprise
towards stability, standardization, and reliability. This talk will
present the policies and frameworks we have developed at Genentech to
enable internal scientists to responsibly leverage open-source tools and
to participate in the community process through their own contributions.

\textbf{Adrian Waddell}, Roche

\emph{Thursday, 16th August from 11:30 - 11:50}

Creating datasets and tables, listings and graphs (TLGs) for analyzing
clinical trials data with R, such that in the final stage the code,
datasets and TLGs can be submitted to the health authorities, is a
multifaceted problem. We have been working on a number of R packages to
create an R-based analysis environment that can be used for exploratory
and regulatory analysis of clinical trials data. These projects include:
table creation (open source \url{http://github.com/Roche/rtables});
random data generation; querying CDISC standards; TLG creation; a
pipeline for specifying and producing data and TLG deliverables (with
logs, automation, titles and footnotes, etc.); a modular shiny-based
exploratory framework that provides dynamic encodings, variable-based
filtering, and R-code generation for the displayed outputs. The maturity
of these projects varies, but the workflow and analysis environment as a
whole can be demonstrated nicely. In this talk, we would like to
generate interest in collaboration in order to make these projects more
general and with the final goal of open-sourcing some of them.

\textbf{Andy Nicholls}, GlaxoSmithKline

\emph{Thursday, 16th August from 17:15 - 17:25}

The first challenge in validating an analytic tool for the
pharmaceutical industry is that, despite a formal FDA definition, there
is still no cross-industry agreement on what `validation' really means
with respect to an analytic tool. AIMS (Application and Implementation
of Methodologies in Statistics), a Special Interest Group within PSI
have been attempting to answer this question with respect to R. In doing
so we recently received approval from the R Consortium for an online R
package validation repository and are now looking to formalise some
early definitions. In this presentation I will walk through some of the
challenges that we have identified thus far and outline what we're
hoping to achieve with the platform.

transforming from a clinical study statistical programmer to a SAS/R
bilingual, as well as my journey of leading the R initiative in Amgen's
Global Statistical Programming Department and Amgen R meetup, working
with IS, statistician, quality, LMS and external partners. I will

\textbf{Boyd Gonnerman, John Sims, Frank DePierro and Peter Giardina},
Pfizer

\emph{Wednesday, 15th August from 10:30 - 10:40}

The Data Science team in Pfizer's Vaccine Research and Development
division (VRD) creates and maintains validated applications used during
high-throughput clinical testing that enable advanced analytic and
reporting requirements. SAS has long been the de-facto standard for
analyzing data in a regulated GxP environment. Web deployment of these
applications has been the best approach, and Pfizer VRD has developed
several mid-tier applications in Java that submit batch SAS processes on
a High Performance Computing grid. Pfizer VRD's high level approach is
the same across different assay platforms: data are pulled from a
combination of electronic files and Oracle databases and analyzed,
results are written back to an Oracle database, and electronic output
files are made in various formats (e.g.~PDF). The regulated nature of
Pfizer VRD's work and the difficulty in deploying R-based applications
over the web have previously been an impediment to the use of R, but new
tools such as RStudio's Shiny Server Pro have helped us overcome those
challenges. This presentation focuses on a comparison of the
architecture used to deploy our SAS applications and the infrastructure
required to deploy R-based applications to meet GxP requirements. Real
life examples will be provided to illustrate the usefulness of this
platform in a regulated laboratory environment.

\textbf{Carson Sievert}, Sievert Consulting

\emph{Thursday, 16th August from 10:10 - 10:30}

Interactive web graphics are a popular and convenient medium for
conveying information. However, web graphics are rarely used during the
initial exploratory phase of a data analysis, largely due to the lack
tools for seamless iteration between data manipulation, modeling, and
visualization. As we've known for several decades, interactive graphics
can augment exploratory analysis, but are only practical when we can
iterate quickly. This talk demonstrates how to use the R packages plotly
and dashR to rapidly produce interactive web graphics and applications
that augment data exploration in addition to being easily distributed.

\textbf{Chase Clark}, Student, University of Illinois at Chicago

\emph{Wednesday, 15th August from 10:40 - 10:50}

The success of a bacterial drug discovery program can be no greater than
the phylogenetic diversity and capacity of those bacteria in the library
to produce specialized metabolites (SM). However, the methods used to
create bacterial strain libraries have seen little innovation in nearly
80 years. Current practice relies entirely on colony morphology and/or
16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis to decide which isolated strains to
retain for addition to a drug discovery library. However, these
practices create inefficient libraries plagued with a high degree of
taxonomic and chemical redundancy by relying on physical characteristics
that have limited correlation with strains' SM, the foundation of drug
discovery. Therefore, the development of a platform to rapidly
prioritize unknown bacterial strains based on phylogeny and SM would
greatly increase the efficiency of the front-end of microbial drug
discovery. Our lab has recently developed such a platform, called IDBac,
which uses in situ matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to analyze protein and
specialized metabolite spectra of single bacterial colonies. Utilizing R
and Shiny, alongside state-of-the-art packages and techniques in MALDI
processing and data visualization, we created a stand-alone executable
program for MALDI-TOF MS bacterial analysis. Using unsupervised learning
methods and visualizations we have demonstrated IDBac's capabilities by
creating protein and specialized metabolite MS profiles, generating
protein MS hierarchical groupings that accurately mirrored phylogenetic
groupings and further distinguishing isolates based on inter- and
intra-species differences in specialized metabolite production. With the
ease of use of modern MALDI instrumentation and interactive, intuitive
data exploration, IDBac can rapidly profile up to 384 bacteria in 4
hours. To our knowledge, IDBac is the first attempt to couple in situ MS
analyses of protein content and specialized metabolite production and
will enable laboratories with access to a MALDI-TOF MS the ability to
rapidly create more efficient libraries for their drug discovery
programs.

\textbf{Daniel Lee}, Generable

\emph{Thursday, 16th August from 16:35 - 16:45}

Precision medicine typically refers to the development of drugs and
other interventions for individual patients. But how do you assess
efficacy and make predictions in this extreme small data regime?

The Bayesian framework is ideal for this type of inference as it allows
us to combine population and personal effects in a principled way and
make predictions for both groups and individuals. The inferences are
further improved when we introduce mechanistically inspired components
into the modeling framework.

I'll talk about building pharma models in the small data regime and how
we use Stan (a statistical modeling language for Bayesian inference)
with R for analysis.

\textbf{Devin Pastoor}, Metrum Research Group

\emph{Thursday, 16th August from 11:50 - 12:15}

Despite the explosive growth and adoption of R globally, concerns over
how to qualify and administrate R continues to echo in discussions about
use in regulated environments. In this talk, I'll discuss the how to
bridge the conceptual tenants of reproducibility, traceability, and
accuracy to robust, yet agile, implementations such that and
organization can maintain validated systems without imposing the
shackles found in traditional validated environments. Furthermore, I
will discuss a number of design elements specific to the open-source R
ecosystem, such as using packages from CRAN and github, and cover how to
embrace these, while responsibly managing risk in enterprise
environments.

\emph{Wednesday, 15th August from 14:10 - 14:20}

The dramatic increase of R in the computational, analytics, and data
science areas has led to some innovative techniques in recent years for
interactive analytics. This rate of change presents challenges for IT
organizations to keep up and to maintain their software stacks for
scientists for regulated and non-regulated environments. Techniques and
Best Practices for managing updates and use cases will be presented from

\emph{Thursday, 16th August from 16:55 - 17:05}

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that
clinical trial data be submitted in the Study Data Tabulation Model
(SDTM) standard format. The process of developing SDTM involves mapping
captured raw data to their correspondent SDTM domains based on rules and
conditions put by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium
(CDISC) organization. SDTM data is further used for building the
Analysis Data Model (ADaM) which is used for clinical trial statistical
analysis. Mistakes in the mapping process are common due to the process
complexities; issues that are missed may potentially affect the clinical
trial result. Therefore, it is very essential to preserve the quality of
the SDTM data. Currently, the main tool for checking SDTM conformance is
Pinnacle21 (formerly known as OpenCDISC). Notably, there are usability
and viability checks that are not included in Pinnacle21. This work
describes the creation of an R shiny app to supplement the Pinnacle21
checks. This interactive app applies various CDISC-compliant SDTM data
validation checks, and provides the user with a comprehensive report on
possible inconsistencies in the data. The app would allow programmers to
proactively find data mapping errors. In addition, it is straightforward
to use and can save tremendous amounts of time. Additionally, this app's
audience extends beyond the programming community and covers other

Recent advances in the Shiny ecosystem boost the scale and scope of
serious enterprise-wide web applications. More specifically, it is
entirely possible to utilize key features of Shiny Server Professional
and additional R packages such as shinyjs, DT, and batchtools to build
Shiny applications that supports session management, high-performance
computing, and reproducibility in a friendly and logical interface.
Additionally, the shinytest package enables a robust workflow for
developing applications efficiently, as well as being an important
component to automate a validation testing framework. In this talk, I
will share examples of key features and lessons learned in creating a
technically powerful shiny application that integrates these pieces
together.

Research is an incremental, iterative process, with new results relying
and building upon previous ones. Scientists need to find, retrieve,
understand, and trust results in order to confidently extend them, even
when the results are their own. We present the GREX framework, which
facilitates this iterative process via the principled management of
computational results. GREX combines robust storage, provenance
tracking, automated annotation, discoverability, and reproduciblity of
computational results. We will discuss both the underlying conceptual
work and our reference implementation of our framework.

In 3 years Real World Data Science Analytics in Roche/Genentech
transitioned from a small team of former clinical trial programmers
supporting a real world evidence team to become the largest department
within the Personalised Healthcare (PHC) Centre of Excellence. This
transition was driven by industry-wide acknowledgement of the growing
importance of leveraging analytics to support PHC, but this change
necessitated radical changes in workflows and competencies. To adapt to
this change, the team has moved from using a single proprietary software
(SAS) to becoming an open source-focused, R based but increasingly
programming language agnostic, department. A core driver of this
transition was the development of an internal suite of R packages that
handled markdown templates and database access through to wrappers for
common plots and documenting git hashes of all code used. Bringing this
diverse set of tools into a coherent eco-system is a meta-package
modelled on the tidyverse.

Recruitment models for clinical trials are notoriously difficult to
build due to many complex factors within a study. With input from
experienced practitioners, we have built an interactive tool to allow
individuals to build complex recruitment models using the R/Shiny
framework. The Tool Enhance R, our platform for study modeling, was
ported from an Excel-based tool to the R/Shiny platform to increase
model development speed, expand capability and drive transparency into
model development. The tool allows users to specify critical model
attributes (i.e.~country site distribution, recruitment/activation
rates, country-specific vacations), and provide instantaneous feedback
that changes have on a model's probability of success. Using the RStudio
Connect platform, we are able to grant multi-level access to users
through a single web interface. Model development is tracked by
exporting results to a SharePoint site and logging versions for future
review/auditing. This gives significant levels of transparency on how a
model was created and evolved over time. For web analytics, we used
Piwik, and internal web analytics platform, to monitor how users
navigate through the platform and identify browsing behavior. The
application was built upon the Shiny Dashboard framework and leverages
many visualization packages, including Plotly, Timevis, ggplot2 and many
more. Many challenges arose in its develop, from controlling
over-zealous user clicks causing out of control execution, to
integrating service account execution of apps to facilitate centralized
data control. This project pushed the limits of what the R/Shiny
platform is capable of and demonstrates how data scientists can build
useful solutions.

R Shiny has revolutionized the way statisticians and analysts distribute
analytic results and research methods. We can easily build interactive
web tools that enhance data visualization and facilitate data and
information sharing. Shiny apps can empower non-statisticians to explore
and visualize their data or perform their own analyses with methods we
develop. Harnessing this power, R users have developed Shiny apps for
visualizing clinical trials and pharmaceutical data, as well as
applications that aid in study design and analysis. I will present
examples of how Shiny can be used in many stages of the drug development
process and discuss the challenges as well as benefits of incorporating
these tools in pharmaceutical workflows.

\emph{Wednesday, 15th August from 16:05 - 16:15}

Cohort studies of treatments developed from healthcare claims often have
hundreds of thousands of patients and up to several thousand measured
covariates. Therefore, new causal inference methods that combine ideas
from machine learning and causal inference may improve analysis of these
studies by taking advantage of the wealth of information measured in
claims. In order to evaluate the performance of these methods as applied
to claims-based studies, we use a combination of real data examples and
plasmode simulation, implemented in R package `plasmode', which creates
realistic simulated datasets based on a real cohort study. In this talk,
I will give an overview of our progress so far and what is left to be
done.

During the drug development, pharmacometric models are often built to
characterize and understand drug efficacy and safety. Simulations based
on these models can assist drug development and quantitative decision
making. However, computation can be time-consuming and communication
with the project team may not be productive. Shiny applications are
developed as a simulation tool which allows rapid real-time simulations
based on user-selected inputs and dynamic visualization of the results.
It provides an easy access to individuals with no specific background of
modeling and simulation. In the talk, I will present some case studies
where the shiny application was used to perform simulations and
facilitate the communication with decision makers.

\emph{Thursday, 16th August from 17:05 - 17:15}

The pharmaceutical industry depends on accurate and reproducible data
science for both preclinical and clinical analysis. Unfortunately, often
an analysis cannot be reproduced and therefore its computational
methodology and merit are unknown. Often, the data, code, or description
of computational methods is not maintained. In order to implement good
practices of reproducible computational research, the leadership of the
company must invest time and resources into planning, training, ensuring
adoption of common practices and tools, implementing documentation
systems, encouraging discipline on the individual and group level,
creating incentives, and requiring accountability. At Eisai, we have
developed a working system for reproducible computational research that
is enabled by leadership, technology, and culture. With regards to
technology, we primarily use Rmarkdown and R Notebooks on an Rstudio
server used by all our analysts. The Rstudio server is maintained by an
administrator who installs packages for all users, creating a common
package environment that ensures that code can be rerun in the future.
Data and code are stored in a shared network drive and version control
is accomplished by using Git. A wiki that is editable by all analysts is
used to organize all analyses (tracked with unique analysis IDs) and
provides links to code and results.

With regards to culture, the leadership has promoted the values of
quality and reproducibility. When yearly objectives are set, the
performance criteria includes the creation of analysis documents
(e.g.~Rmarkdown reports), use of version control, and organization of
data on shared network drives. Setting aside time for wiki documentation
in the midst of high demands from project teams is helped by having
periodic ``documentation day'' parties. To verify reproducibility, we
have implemented ``witnessing'': once the analysis is finished, it is
reviewed by an independent team member who officially signs off on the
work, stating that the reproducibility criteria have been met. Our
success in implementing reproducible computational research can serve as
a model for other companies to use. Here we have provided a model based
on leadership, technology, and culture.

\textbf{Juliane Manitz}, EMD Serono

\emph{Wednesday, 15th August from 11:40 - 11:50}

Safety and efficacy data in clinical trials are mostly analyzed
separately. However, especially the treatment of life-threatening
disease such as cancer requires a good understanding of benefit and
associated risks to make an informed therapy decision for an individual
patient. Recently approved immunotherapeutic drugs in oncology are
associated with potential side effects such as immune-related
hypothyroidism, rash and colitis. There is some biological reasoning
that the occurrence of immune-related adverse events and corresponding
management may compromise the drug response. On the other hand, it has
been observed that patients responding to treatment might face a higher
likelihood of adverse drug reactions. A multi-state model is able to
explore these hypotheses and offers the opportunity of insights into
potential associations while addressing some of the methodological
challenges. For example, the necessity of a time-dependent approach to
accommodate the fact that safety and efficacy events can occur
throughout the treatment. Moreover, longer treatment duration can impact
simultaneously the likelihood of efficacy as well as safety events,
i.e., introducing immortal time bias. The multistate model is able to
unfold this spurious correlation. We present an approach for analysis
and exemplify the methodology with simulated data.

\emph{Wednesday, 15th August from 15:55 - 16:05}

Decision analysis balancing both data analytics and human gut feeling is
critical in designing efficient routes to synthesize new, complex small
molecules. This challenge is faced by any organization seeking to
deliver modern pharmaceutical compounds to patients in a prompt manner.
In this presentation, we highlight the incorporation of data science
approaches using R to develop metrics that aid in the development
process: current complexity, risk quantification, and process efficiency
forecasting. Current complexity is a metric established from human
insights that assesses a molecule's complexity in the context of
capability, tracking the `current' complexity of a given molecule over
time and enabling the quantitative assessment of a new route or process.
Risk quantification utilizes a Bayesian framework to quantify risk from
real data and operational patterns, at both the project and portfolio
level, for assessing the delivery risk of early candidate nomination
assets in areas such as FTE resource modeling. Process efficiency can be
estimated with a predictive analytics framework capable of quantifying
the probable efficiency of a proposed synthesis or benchmarking the
outcome performance of the developed process, thereby minimizing the
environmental impact of pharmaceutical production. These strategies have
been effectively used to aid the decision-making processes for
pharmaceutical R\&D.

R is a very powerful tool for performing statistical programming, but
has had a lower uptake in the life sciences when compared to SAS. As a
result, many of the packages created for R are not focused on the type
of tasks Statistical Programmers do. In this talk I introduce several
packages and in house training we are developing to aid regulatory
outputs. The R packages include rcompare, a package to allow comparison
of datasets, analogous to proc compare in SAS, and r4spa which allows
outputs to be in the correct format for production. Each package solves
a problem particular to the life sciences, and is intended to improve
uptake of R usage within the industry. Similarly, to the R packages, the
training is focused on providing examples of actual work, so that users
of the training will be able to immediately apply their knowledge.

The interaction between the Major Histocompatibility Complex type I
(MHC-I), a peptide and the T-cell receptor (TCR) (MHCI::p::TCR) is a key
determinant of immune response elicitation and therefore of paramount
importance in infectious- and autoimmune diseases and cancer. Current
state-of-the-art models developed by our group can with great precision
model MHCI::p interactions. Using data from VDJdb and IEDB, we created
an ensemble of convolutional neural networks, which to the best of our
knowledge is the world's first sequence based model capable of capturing
the entire MHCI::p::TCR system. Due to limited data, we however
currently can only model the interaction between the CDR3 region of the
TCR's beta chain with HLA-A*02:01 and 3 peptides. However, as the model
framework is easily extendable, we will increase the breadth and thus
improve the model, as soon as more data become available. Using the
current model and an independent test set, we obtained AUC = 0.747.

RNA-seq data is biased and accurate detection of differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) is not a trivial task. While the data collection
can be considered high-throughput, data analysis has intricacies that
require careful human attention. The most effective approach to modern
data analysis is to iterate between models and visuals, and to enhance
the appropriateness of models based on feedback from visuals. As it
stands, there is a need to make it easier for scientists and clinicians
to use models and visuals in a complimentary fashion during RNA-seq data
analysis. Here, we use public RNA-seq data to show that our
visualization tools can detect normalization problems, DEG designation
problems, and common errors in RNA-seq analysis. We also show that our
tools can identify genes of interest that cannot be obtained with
models. Through this project, we propose that users slightly modify
their approach to data analysis by quickly assessing the sensibility of
their models with statistical graphics. We plan to publish a new R
software package that includes the plotting techniques introduced in
this project, which can be useful for exploring several types of
multivariate biological data such as RNA-sequencing data.

When it comes to analytics of data collected in medical research,
today's culture is compartmentalized -- not only across institutions,
but even within institutions. Such a culture stagnates analytical
development and limits the ability to fully master the data thereby
reducing the effectiveness in communicating clinical information to
stakeholders. A unified culture can exist -- statisticians, programmers,
and clinicians need to speak to each other; regulatory agencies,
pharmaceutical companies, and academics need to speak to each other.
Once everyone comes together to discuss how the medical research data
should be collected, interrogated and presented; analytics can be
developed and shared within and across institutions. From an analytics
perspective, nothing new needs to be developed, solutions are already
available -- many of them free. We just need to come together and start

A physiologically-based mathematical model was developed as a series of
ordinary differential equations to describe compositional changes (in
fat and fat-free mass, FM \& FFM) due to metabolizable energy exchanges
in babies from birth to 2 years in low-to-middle income countries.1 The
objective of this work was to identify potential biomarkers for future
intervention studies, identify when to intervene to protect and/or
rescue growth in individuals suffering from malnutrition, and to
identify which of these individuals would be more or less likely to
respond to a nutritional intervention.

A translation of this model (155 parameters and 26 compartments) using R
and the open-source mrgsolve package2 provided an efficient platform for
multi-parameter optimization, as required during additional model
development and for subsequent simulations. For comparison, a 8.62
seconds simulation with viral and bacterial infections (no
interventions) in the R/mrgsolve implementation required 226 seconds in
Matlab. Model translation to R also enabled simulations with a Shiny
App, allowing users to simulate individual infant phenotypes and
infection events and visualize growth and energy levels over time,
relative to healthy (WHO) standards.

The model currently also includes a relatively simple implementation of
persistent antibiotic therapy with a potential for inclusion of drug
exposure-related effects, i.e. - through a pharmacokinetic (PK) model,
to describe effects of antiviral or antibiotic therapy. The challenge to
this development is the scarcity of available data describing this
therapy in malnourished children that would be needed for model
calibration. Further development of the model includes linking to other
systems models such Mother-fetus energy exchange or PBPK mother-fetus
models, to enable simulations of growth beginning at gestation.

reports for regulatory authorities submissions. bioWARP enables people
using advanced statistical methods, who cannot program R. It builds a
connection to the validated R-packages developed at Roche with an easy
to use and elegant user interface. Its modular environment can host an
unlimited number of such interfaces. bioWARP now consists of tools for
reporting reference ranges, equality by linear regression, precision by
variance component analysis and homogeneity by inhouse developed
equivalence tests . bioWARP's most important feature is the ability to
move all statistical evaluations right into PDF reports. These are
validated and can directly be used for submission to regulatory
authorities. bioWARP is called the ``largest shiny application in the
world'' by us as it already consists of 16 tools, has over 100.000 lines
of code, \textgreater{}500 buttons and interaction items and is growing
and growing and growing.

\emph{Wednesday, 15th August from 16:35 - 16:45}

The rOpenSci project is a non-profit initiative founded as a grassroots
effort in 2011. We have evolved into a truly global community of
researchers and data scientists who are R users and developers from a
wide range of disciplines. rOpenSci advocates for a culture of open and
reproducible research. We do this by creating technical infrastructure
in the form of carefully vetted, staff- and community-contributed R
software tools that lower barriers to working with scientific data
sources on the web. We have developed a highly successful model for peer
review of scientific software that provides transparent, constructive
and collegial review of R packages.

Our community is our best asset. We are building social infrastructure
in the form of a welcoming and diverse community. rOpenSci.org hosts
blog posts by authors and reviewers of onboarded packages to share both
functionality and lessons learned; we promote these on social media to
bring their work to a wider audience. Our discussion forum, community
calls and annual hackathon-flavored unconference are designed to share
best practices and to build a trust network for the often challenging
discussions about doing research more reproducibly.

Failure to thoroughly review discrepancies and deviations in drug
manufacturing is consistently one of the top citations in FDA
inspectional observations. Learn how a leading biotechnology
organization successfully replaced an inefficient, manual inspection
process with a genealogy visualization and inspection solution to
optimize drug manufacturing quality control. This session will cover
implementation approaches and lessons learned in data mapping,
technology selection, visualization development, and predictive model
generation.

\emph{Wednesday, 15th August from 14:00 - 14:10}

Next-generation sequencing (NGS), phage display technology and high
throughput capacities enables biologists in drug discovery to
characterize antibodies (Abs) based on their HCDR3 sequences and further
group them into families before moving to hit-to-lead stage of drug
discovery and development. This enables diversification of Ab portfolio
and insures back up options if Ab candidate fails. However, there was no
method or software available in-house to support Ab discovery with
capacities to apply biophysical rules to classify the sequences. Shiny
app ``Group My Abs'' was developed to apply biophysical properties for
Ab characterization to the NGS data. Several Multiple Sequence Alignment
algorithms implemented in the app enable sequence comparability. A
method was developed to evaluate differences between comparable
sequences and subsequently classify sequences into families. The app
provides custom-made and interactive data visualization, enables refined
Ab classification in a mathematical manner, considerably increases
efficiency and insures reproducibility. This all decreases bias and
enables informative decision making during the hit-to-lead stage in
biologics drug discovery.

\emph{Thursday, 16th August from 14:10 - 14:20}

The drake package is a general-purpose workflow manager for data-driven
tasks in R, with applications in the pharmaceutical industry ranging
from tailored medicine to clinical trial simulation and beyond. Drake
rebuilds intermediate data objects when their dependencies change, and
it skips work when the results are already up to date. Not every
runthrough starts from scratch, and completed workflows have tangible
evidence of reproducibility. Drake is more scalable than knitr, more
thorough than memoization, and more R-focused than other pipeline
toolkits such as GNU Make, remake, and snakemake.

\textbf{Xiao Ni}, Novartis

\emph{Wednesday, 15th August from 15:35 - 15:55}

R has become a prominent data science tool, empowered by a fast-growing
modern R eco-system. At Novartis, Shiny and markdown have gained a lot
of popularity in analyzing, visualizing and reporting of clinical trial
data. Traditional report analysis plan (RAP) process was designed to
create static table, figure and listings. In this talk, I will use
ShinyRAP (a shiny app) to illustrate a novel framework/workflow of
planning and executing of both pre-specified and ad-hoc analyses, as
well as building dynamic/interactive reports through R/Shiny/Markdown.
The app features efficient and organized programming through meta-data
and shiny modules, and dynamic display of results via multi-select,
grouping and searching, etc. Although motivated from a clinical trial
data context, this framework can also be used for other types of data.

\emph{Thursday, 16th August from 15:45 - 15:55}

In Pharmaceutical industry, personalized patient care is about having
access to traditional and new data sources including comprehensive
diagnostic data, sensor data, real-world data, etc., applying
traditional and advanced analytics like machine learning to create
meaningful insights, and then realizing value from those insights for
smarter and more efficient research and development (R\&D) and improving
patient access and personalized patient care. Biomarker research is a
key component of the PHC Strategy, complementing efforts to access
high-dimensional genomics data and conducting appropriated analysis
using right tools differentiate from those for current well-established
clinical trials. This paper, in perspective of R\&D, describes the close
collaboration between China Oncology Biomarker Data group (OBD China)
and Product Development Biometrics (PDB) expertise, from sample
collection, lab process in biomarker stand-alone studies to meaningful
results mainly conducted in R, which enables to prioritize molecule
development, inform the design of specific trials and identify R\&D
opportunities for regional diseases.
